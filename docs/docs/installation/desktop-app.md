# Desktop Application / Installer
## Installation
This is the easiest method and recommanded for users with less terminal experience. Just go to the [Releases](https://github.com/josephdadams/TallyArbiter/releases) page, grab the latest installer for Windows, MacOS or Linux, run it and you're ready to use TallyArbiter! After installation you can run it just like any other program.
## Upgrading
The Autoupdater for the Desktop version will be available soon. For now, just download the new installer and run it when there's an update available.

**Be sure to back up or save your [config file](#configuration)!**
